# Welcome to the Pack

This workbook is yours. Write in it. Mark it up.
The notes you take here are worth more than the slides.

By the end of this class you will have:

- [ ] Your own private cloud server running 24/7
- [ ] Claude Code installed and connected to your API key
- [ ] Your personal AI harness — tuned to your business, your tools, your problems
- [ ] At least one working agent you built yourself
- [ ] Access to the Wolf Pack community for continued support

# About Wolf

*[Wolf — add your bio here: background in PM, how you discovered AI coding, what you've built,
why you created this class. 2-3 paragraphs. Personal. Real.]*

# How This Class Works

This is not a lecture. You will be building something real by end of Day 1.

| | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 (half day) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Morning** | Setup + your first agent | Build your own tool | Polish + deploy |
| **Afternoon** | Agents deep dive | Build cont'd | Community + next steps |
| **You leave with** | Server running, first agent built | Your custom tool | A plan for what's next |

**The rule of this class:** If you're confused, say so out loud.
There are no dumb questions. There are only questions that slow down one person
versus questions that help everyone.

# Part 1 — Understanding the Stack

## What You're Building

```
Your Mac / PC (Claude Code Desktop app)
        │
        │  SSH connection
        ▼
   Your VPS (Hostinger — Ubuntu Linux)
   ├── Claude Code CLI
   ├── Your Harness (CLAUDE.md)
   └── Your Projects
        │
        │  git push / pull
        ▼
   Your GitHub Repo
   (github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wolf-pack)
```

## The Three Things That Matter

**1. The Server** — Your own cloud computer. Runs 24/7. Costs $5/month.
This is where your agents live and run.

**2. The Harness** — Your `CLAUDE.md` file. This is your AI's instruction manual.
It tells Claude who you are, what you manage, what tools you use, and how you want to work.
The better your CLAUDE.md, the better every single session.

**3. The API Key** — Your personal connection to Claude's brain.
Think of it like a SIM card. You pay for what you use (~$5-15/month for light use).

# Part 2 — Your First Agent

## What Is an Agent?

A chatbot answers questions. An agent **takes actions**.

| Chatbot | Agent |
|---|---|
| "Here's how to write a late rent notice" | Writes the notice, creates the work order, texts the vendor |
| Answers one thing per message | Chains multiple steps without being asked |
| You do the work | It does the work |

## The Maintenance Request Agent (Live Demo)

*Watch what happens when we give Claude a real tenant text.*

**Input:** One tenant message
**Output:** 5 things — triage decision, tenant reply, work order, vendor dispatch, next step

**Time manually:** 15–20 minutes
**Time with the agent:** 45 seconds

# Part 3 — Your Harness (CLAUDE.md)

## Why This Is the Most Important File You Own

Every session you open with Claude, it reads your CLAUDE.md first.
It's the difference between Claude acting like a generic assistant
and Claude acting like someone who has worked with you for 6 months.

## What Goes In It

- Who you are and what your company does
- Your properties and how many units you manage
- Your tech stack — every tool you use
- How you want Claude to work with you
- Things you never want it to do

## Filling in Your Tech Stack

Use the setup form at **[WOLF PACK SETUP FORM LINK]** — or edit your CLAUDE.md directly.

### My Tech Stack (fill this in now)

| Category | Tool I Use | What I Still Do Manually |
|---|---|---|
| PM Software | | |
| Process / Workflow | | |
| Email | | |
| Internal Comms | | |
| Phone System | | |
| Tenant Texting | | |
| Lease Signing | | |
| Payments | | |
| Accounting | | |
| Maintenance | | |

# Part 4 — Building Your Tool (Day 2)

## My Problem Statement

*Write the specific thing you do manually every week that you want to automate:*

_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

*How long does it take you currently?*  _______ minutes/hours per week

*What's the input?* (e.g., a spreadsheet, a text message, a list of names)

_______________________________________________

*What's the output you want?* (e.g., an email, a report, a text, a work order)

_______________________________________________

## My Build Plan (Claude will help you write this)

Ask Claude: *"Based on my CLAUDE.md and this problem, what would you build for me and how?
Give me a plan in plain English before writing any code."*

**What Claude suggested:**

**What I asked it to change:**

## My Next 3 Builds

After today, what are the next 3 things you want to build?

1. _______________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________

3. _______________________________________________

**Ask Claude on your next session:** *"I want to build [#1]. Based on my CLAUDE.md,
what tools do I already have that we should connect to? What's the plan?"*

## Staying in Touch

**Wolf Pack GitHub:** github.com/wocros/wolf-pack
*(bookmark this — new templates and agents are added regularly)*

**Wolf's email:** *[YOUR EMAIL]*

**Community:** *[CRANE LINK]*

# Quick Reference

## The Commands You'll Use Most

```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh root@YOUR_IP

# Start Claude
cd /root/wolf-pack && claude

# Save changes to GitHub
git add . && git commit -m "what I changed" && git push

# Pull the latest Wolf Pack updates
git pull origin main
```

## When You Get Stuck

**Claude seems confused or off-track:** Start a new session. Type: "Read my CLAUDE.md and tell me what you know about my business." Reorient before asking for help.

**Something broke:** Type: "Something isn't working. Here's what I did: [describe]. Here's what happened: [describe]. Don't fix it yet — just tell me what you think went wrong."

**You don't know what to ask:** Type: "I want to improve [area of my business]. What are 3 specific things you could help me build, given my tech stack?"
